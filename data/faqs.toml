    answer = "Fill a report or contact a member of the PyMCon Code of Conduct Enforcement Team directly.<br>Include all relevant context and if possible your contact info too; we will reach out and discuss whether there was a code of conduct violation and advise on how to handle it.<br>We have a code of conduct to be triggered, not for the sake of having one. Also keep in mind that there are many possible outcomes after a code of conduct report, there should be no feeling bad about potential punishments when filling a report."
