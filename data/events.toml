    title = "The Power of Bayes in Industry: Your Business Model is Your Data Generating Process"
    place = "Online"
    description = "This talk will attempt to answer the question what is a Data Generating Process and why does it matter? While we will begin our discussion with a bit of theory, don't worry about this being too technical or inaccessible if you're new to Bayesian Statistics. Our primary goal is to focus on the second half of the question and give you tools to use for real-world applications."

    place = "Online"
    description = "The talk aims to get users quickly up and performing GPs, especially multi-output GPs using PyMC. Several examples with time-series datasets are used to illustrate different GPs features. This presentation will allow users to leverage GPs to analyze their data effectively."

    place = "Online"
    description = "In this talk, I'll introduce a PyMC Hilbert Space Gaussian Process (HSGP) implementation and show via case studies how it fills a few key gaps in the PyMC GP library: fast GPs as model subcomponents, and fast GPs with non-Gaussian likelihoods. I'll also cover tips and tricks for applying HSGPs effectively in practice."
