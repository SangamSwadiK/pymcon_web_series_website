# Contributing Guidelines

PyMCon is a community led event and we encourage you to contribute in any form you demarcate suitable for yourself.

Here are a few possible ways you can contribute:

- [Make a Pull request](###-Make-a-Pull-Request)
- [Create an Issue](###-Create-an-Issue)
- [Personal Feedback](###-Personal-Feedback)


### Make a Pull request

To make a Pull Request, you can follow these steps:
- Fork the repository to your own Github Profile
- Optional: We encourage creating a specific branch in your fork to keep your workflow clean (this branch should be created from main)
- Make the necessary changes in your local codebase, check the Readme.md for more information on the website deployment.
- If you have questions about hugo or the template while making a PR then add them as comments after making the PR.
- Submit PR!

Note: We recommend raising an issue and letting it be known that you wish to make a PR (unless it's a really small change).
This is to ensure that you don't accidentally waste time on doing something that has not been previously discussed.


### Create an issue

If there is something in the website code or the repository that you think can be:
- Improved
- Corrected
- Changed

Then create an issue.

### Personal Feedback

Is there something you want to help with, and really think it should be discussed in private? Email the organizers. 
Please use your own judgement to decide what is appropriate. 
A few examples of reasonable emails are - accessibility issues you want to discuss in detail personally.
While this is possible, we strongly encourage opening public issues, so everybody sees them and we can act on it sooner.

## Note

- Please follow the [Code of Conduct](https://pymcon.com/codeofconduct/) throughout. 
- Be kind and sensitive of other people's time. 
- Try to be as informative as possible in your issues and PRs, so that you provide sufficient context. 
- For example, when creating an issue for a bug, or a PR for fixing it - 
  describe the relevant problem in detail with possible links to file or output information

## Resources

If you are not familiar with git, and/or hugo: 

- For making a PR we recommend checking the [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
- For Hugo, we recommend checking [Hugo Docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/)

Ofcourse you can always ask questions in the Issue or PR itself as well!
